Creating Servers: We learned how to set up a basic HTTP server to handle requests and send responses.
File System: We practiced using the fs module to perform file operations like reading and writing files.
Package Management: We worked with npm to install external packages like generate-password and nodemailer and learned how to use them in Node.js.
Email Sending: We encountered authentication issues with Gmail and solved them by enabling App Passwords and adjusting security settings.
